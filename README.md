# Market Basket Analysis 

### Note
Group project in the course "Data Mining: Theory and Technologies" (Fall 2020).

## Overview
We implemented Apriori algorithm and FP-Growth algorithm to mine association rules in sales datasets. Our findings have been visualized with the use of Python and R.

The original report was written in Jupyter Notebook (Python 3) and R Markdown. I transformed the original files into .py  and .R files to view the source code conveniently.
